# Project Hogwarts

Since its inception sometime in the 10th century, Hogwarts has proudly educated the magical
youth of Great Britain. While the magical community has been known to be a bit “stuck in their
ways”, the newest headmaster has decided that it’s finally time to start incorporating some of the
magic of the internet in the administration of Hogwarts. The headmaster has commissioned a
web-based database that will be used to keep track of all of Hogwarts’ students, professors,
classes, and houses.
With 4 houses, 52+ students per house, and 20+ professors, the headmaster is in charge of
400+ individuals. Along with keeping a record of student and professor details, the headmaster
can use this database to find where a student or professor is at any point during class hours.
The database is also used to keep track of positive and negative point assignments given to
students by professors.
